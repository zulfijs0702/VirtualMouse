Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures

Problem Statement:Traditional computer interaction relies heavily on physical devices such as mouse and keyboards. However, for individuals who prefer touch-free control, a gesture-controlled virtual mouse provides an innovative alternative. This project aims to create a virtual mouse that allows users to control their cursor through hand gestures, enhancing convenience and introducing a novel form of human-computer interaction.

Solution:This project leverages Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to create a virtual mouse controlled entirely by hand gestures. Using real-time video capture, the application tracks hand landmarks, identifies movement patterns, and translates them into cursor movements and click actions. The software detects gestures for left-click, right-click, double-click, and taking screenshots, offering an intuitive and smooth user experience. The real-time nature of the application ensures seamless control, and the system runs efficiently even on modest hardware configurations.

Features:

Hand Tracking with OpenCV & MediaPipe: The application detects hand movements using a webcam and processes them in real-time to control the mouse cursor.

Gesture-Based Mouse Control: Users can perform actions like left-click, right-click, double-click, and taking screenshots using predefined hand gestures.

Smooth and Responsive Control: The system ensures minimal latency and high accuracy in tracking, allowing users to navigate their computer effortlessly.

Lightweight and Efficient: The software runs smoothly on most systems without requiring high computational resources, making it practical for everyday use.

Potential for Customization: Additional gestures can be implemented to expand functionality, providing users with more control options in future updates.

Tech Stack: Python (Main Programming Language), OpenCV (Image Processing & Hand Tracking), MediaPipe (Hand Tracking API)

Target Audience: Office workers and professionals who want a hands-free way to control their computer, Presentation speakers who need to navigate slides without a physical mouse, Gamers and tech enthusiasts looking for innovative interaction methods.
